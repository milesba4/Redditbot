# Redditbot

## Details
a. My bot isn't advocating for or opposing any politician. It is simply appreciative of the color green.

b. This is my favorite thread involving my bot. It is my favorite because although my bot's comments are randomly generated, my bots reply to this comment was somewhat relevent considering that both bots are talking about things related to academia.
